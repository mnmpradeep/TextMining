Text mining is the discovery of interesting knowledge in
text documents. It is a challenging issue to find accurate
knowledge (or features) in text documents to help users to
find what they want. In the beginning, Information
Retrieval (IR) provided many term-based methods to solve
this challenge, such as Rocchio and probabilistic models [4],
rough set models [23], BM25 and support vector machine
(SVM) [34] based filtering models.
