The time complexity of Algorithm 2 in Fig. 3 is decided
by step 2, the number of calls for Shuffling algorithm and
the number of using  operation. Step 2 takes O�nm�. For
each noise negative pattern nd, the algorithm gets its
offenders that takes O�nm 	 jndj� in step 4, and then calls
once Shuffling. After that, it calls n  operation that takes
O�nmm� � O�nm2�.
