In the past decade, a significant number of data mining
techniques have been presented in order to perform
different knowledge tasks. These techniques include association
rule mining, frequent itemset mining, sequential
pattern mining, maximum pattern mining, and closed
pattern mining. Most of them are proposed for the purpose
of developing efficient mining algorithms to find particular
patterns within a reasonable and acceptable time frame.
With a large number of patterns generated by using data
mining approaches, how to effectively use and update these
patterns is still an open research issue. In this paper, we
focus on the development of a knowledge discovery model
to effectively use and update the discovered patterns and
apply it to the field of text mining.
