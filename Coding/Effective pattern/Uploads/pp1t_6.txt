The task of algorithm Shuffling is to tune the support
distribution of terms within a d-pattern. A different strategy
is dedicated in this algorithm for each type of offender. As
stated in step 2 in the algorithm Shuffling, complete conflict
offenders (d-patterns) are removed since all elements
within the d-patterns are held by the negative documents
indicating that they can be discarded for preventing
interference from these possible �noises.�
The parameter offering is used in step 4 for the purpose of
temporarily storing the reduced supports of some terms in a
partial conflict offender. The offering is part of the sum of
supports of terms in a d-pattern where these terms also
appear in a noise document. The algorithm calculates the
base in step 5 which is certainly not zero since
termset�p�  nd 6� ;; and then updates the support distributions
of terms in step 6.
