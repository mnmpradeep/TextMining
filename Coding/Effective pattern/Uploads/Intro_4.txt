The advantages of termbased
methods include efficient computational performance
as well as mature theories for term weighting,
which have emerged over the last couple of decades from
the IR and machine learning communities. However, termbased
methods suffer from the problems of polysemy and
synonymy, where polysemy means a word has multiple
meanings, and synonymy is multiple words having the
same meaning. The semantic meaning of many discovered
terms is uncertain for answering what users want.
