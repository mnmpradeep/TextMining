The basic idea of updating patterns is explained as follows:
complete conflict offenders are removed from d-patterns
first. For partial conflict offenders, their term supports are
reshuffled in order to reduce the effects of noise documents.
The main process of inner pattern evolution is implemented
by the algorithm IPEvolving (see Algorithm 2 in
Fig. 3). The inputs of this algorithm are a set of d-patterns
DP, a training set D � D� [ D. The output is a composed
of d-pattern. Step 2 in IPEvolving is used to estimate the
threshold for finding the noise negative documents. Steps 3
to 10 revise term supports by using all noise negative
documents. Step 4 is to find noise documents and the
corresponding offenders. Step 5 gets normal forms of dpatterns
NDP. Step 6 calls algorithm Shuffling (see Algorithm
3 in Fig. 4) to update NDP according to noise
documents. Steps 7 to 9 compose updated normal forms
together.
