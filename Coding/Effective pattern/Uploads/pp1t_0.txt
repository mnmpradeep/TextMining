In this section, we discuss how to reshuffle supports of
terms within normal forms of d-patterns based on negative
documents in the training set. The technique will be useful
to reduce the side effects of noisy patterns because of the
low-frequency problem. This technique is called inner
pattern evolution here, because it only changes a patternï¿½s
term supports within the pattern.
