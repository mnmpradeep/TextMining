In this section, we discuss how to reshuffle supports of terms within normal forms of d-patterns based on negative
documents in the training set.


The technique will be useful to reduce the side effects of noisy patterns because of the
low-frequency problem.


This technique is called inner pattern evolution here, because it only changes a pattern’s
term supports within the pattern.
